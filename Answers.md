1. What does it mean to think in react?

Everything is a component, it's scaleable and was made to help deal with complex state + using jsx etc for HTML

1. Describe state.

State just is ;) -- no, it's like ice to water to steam, different states of the data/page/render

1. Describe props.

properties passed from one component to another to break down an application and have components with and without state

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects are rendered everytime the DOM is rendered and rerendered - asyncronous code
